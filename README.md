# Personal Gym Workout Tracker

A self-hosted, single user web app for tracking workouts. 

I wrote it to fill a need I have â€“ 
1. I don't want to pay for a tracking app, something which I could write and host myself. I also want to customise it to how I train.
2. I wanted to test the state of AI generated coding. This app is almost entirely generated using gemini 2.5 flash and chatgpt. About all I did was design the data model in SQLite. The rest is prompting, reviewing the code and focusing on shipping a project over a long weekend.
